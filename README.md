# ejd_fieldwork_2021
Emily's code for working on data from 2021 Graham/Froemke collaboration


to use:
* make a conda environment called fieldwork
    `conda create --name fieldwork`

* activate it
    `conda activate fieldwork`

* then install common things

    `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

    `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn`

    `conda install pandas`

    `conda install tifffile`

I'm using the first five images from dennis lab drive > 2021_fieldwork > data > drone_footage > 20210524 to test tiling overlap

`conda install -c conda-forge opencv`
